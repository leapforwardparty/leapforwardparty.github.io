                <p>
                    In the beginning of the 2016 presidential election, our founder Carter Shirley was insidiously fed up with the current 2-party system. One night after being annoyed with the rubbish on CNN and Fox, Mr. Shirley took a stroll on his neighborhood streets for a breath of fresh air ,where he encountered some white police officers brutally beating up a Caribbean man. This man turned out to be Cristofer Mayers. Mr. Shirley feeling enraged from the injustice, intervened and saved Mr. Mayers from continual unjust police brutality. Afterwards, the two continue walking down the streets and begin discussing downfalls of our current political culture. They began devising a plan to create a new political party and agree to propose it in Washington D.C. While at Lindbergh Field, the two witnessed Aaroh Mankad being wrongfully discriminated against by the TSA. Just another “random screening” they said. Afterwards the three met up at departure gate. Since, Mr. Mankad's ideals coincided with principles of the new party, he agreed to join them on their trip to D.C.

                    During a long layover in Texas, the movement for the new party grew. While walking along the Rio Grande they encountered a man named Mateo Flores being questioned by several border patrol agents. The agents questioned Mr. Flores and demanded that he prove his citizenship right there on the spot. Regardless the fact that Mr. Flores was indeed a citizen, the agents threatened to deport him to the other side of the wall….er I mean border. Fortunately, the three men stepped in and defended Mr. Flores until the agents had given up their case and left. Mr. Flores, feeling grateful, joined the group on their quest to D.C. On their way back to El Paso International, the group stopped at a commotion outside the town NRA. There they were introduced to Conner Humble, a fiery advocate against gun control. Mr. Humble had heard the new political movement through chatter on social media and had wished to join them as it sought to move away from the established system. The Leap Forward group then continued towards their destination, D.C.

                    On the flight, Mr. Shirley is seated next to Connar McGinness. He was a strong supporter of the Republican party who even led a political rally for Donald Trump. After a nearly half hour of discussion, Mr. McGinness realized the many downfalls of the current two-party system and that he in fact had much in common with Mr. Shirley's new platform. Meanwhile stewardess Emma Ryan was drawn to discussion and found the new party idea very compelling. For some time, Ms. Ryan had been very irritated with the idea that women weren't encouraged to work in the same fields men were. Since, the Leap Forward movement placed an emphasis on gender equality and women's rights, Ms. Ryan finally found the party that matched her views. Once the plane landed, the group was ready to officially create their new party. However, due to a clerical error Mr. Shirley's bag, containing the sensitive paperwork, was switched with another man on a later flight. So, after a short delay the man turned out to be Will Nguyen, a middle-class taxi driver from Los Angeles. Mr. Nguyen quickly the joined the team as he felt it was unfair for any person to be working 70+ hours a week and barely get by with the bare necessities. Finally, something that once started as an idea had come to fruition. The paperwork was filed and now the Leap Forward Party has become an official political party.

                    Well there you have it, that's how an entire political party was started by a bunch of Americans who came together from all sorts of unique backgrounds. Collectively, we have formed a political platform that will appeal to Americans of all backgrounds and without a doubt lead America into the future. <a href="register.html">Join us, and let's take a leap forward</a>.

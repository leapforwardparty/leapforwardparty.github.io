                        <p>
                            Our economy needs to be a free and open market with equal opportunity. Some restrictions must be kept to ensure workers rights and the prevention of monopolies. For example, a federal minimum wage should be enforced and environmental protection acts must be rewarded.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We support a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp">progressive income tax</a>. As of now, the highest tax bracket is 400k a year. We propose making a tax bracket of people making upwards of 2.5m and 5m a year. We will also rewrite policies on progressive tax to make sure there are no loopholes that exist such as off shore accounts. Everyone pays their fair share in taxes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The corporate tax system needs to be rewritten so that loopholes do not exist and that corporations pay the amount they should be paying. Rewrite policies to encourage large corporations to stay in the United States and to not move jobs overseas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are many flaws in the tax break policy we need to fix the policy on tax breaks so that it can not be taken advantage of and heavily fine the people who do use tax breaks for the wrong reasons.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We need to achieve price stability 
                            We value and need to achieve full employment where if an individual is able to work that individual should be able to work and if we achieve this we can cut unemployment programs, except for disabled people who are unable to work.

                            The Leap Forward party believes that education is essential to achieving the American dream. Consequently, the leap forward party thinks that everyone should have an equal access to educational resources. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Right now schools get their funding from the property taxes of the area surrounding the school. Although on the surface this may seem like a good idea, it is apparent that this system is flawed. The current system allows public school in neighborhoods with high incomes to become education powerhouses. One example is Torrey Pines High School in Del Mar where the median income is $109,000 a year. As a result of this high median income the people in the area buy expensive properties which bring more revenue via property tax for the school. Meanwhile, schools in low income neighborhoods struggle to find money to buy basic supplies like books and other teaching materials. Verbum Dei high school in South Central Los Angeles, where the median income is $30,000 a year, is a perfect example of a flaw in the system. It is apparent that the properties in a neighborhood where the median income is $30,000 are not going to generate a lot of revenue for the school via property tax. As a result schools in these neighborhoods are understaffed, don't have the supplies they need to teach and have outdated classrooms with dated teaching equipment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe that the solution to this problem is to have <span class="underline">residents pay their property taxes to the state and from there the state can distribute the funds to schools based on population</span>. This will ensure that students who grow up in low income neighborhoods will have equal access to educational resources and make the American dream more attainable for students of all backgrounds.

                        <p>
                            College is a right to education. It should be a guaranteed (free) institution where all students can go to further their education and understanding of the world.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            To start, we would <span class="bold">eliminate tuition at public universities</span>. To pay for this, states would have to foot thirty-three percent of the bill, with the government paying for the rest. How would the government pay for this?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Answer: a higher tax of the super wealthy (upwards of 2.5m net income a year) and a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp">tax on Wall Street Speculation</a>. Speculation refers to investment bankers spending money on stocks, goods, and property that they <span class="italicize">think</span> will return a massive gain. Sometimes it is disastrous. The housing crisis of 2008 is such as example. The tax on speculation would be miniscule compared to the money that is exchanged, merely 0.5 percent. This tiny tax would cover public college tuition by a surplus.

                            National Policy
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            In fiscal year 2015, the federal budget is $3.8 trillion. These trillions of dollars make up about 21 percent of the U.S. economy (as measured by Gross Domestic Product, or GDP). It's also about $12,000 for every woman, man and child in the United States.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The U.S. Treasury divides all federal spending into three groups:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>mandatory spending: 2.45 trillion, 64.63%</li>
                            <li>discretionary spending: 1.1 trillion, 29%</li>
                            <li>interest on debt: 229.15 billion, 6.03%</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>
                            Mandatory and discretionary spending account for more than ninety percent of all federal spending, and pay for all of the government services and programs on which we rely. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Interest on debt, which is a much smaller amount than the other two categories, is the interest the government pays on its accumulated debt, minus interest income received by the government for assets it owns. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We propose to decrease the discretionary spending by 20% and split it 50/50 into the mandatory and debt spending. The military is currently overfunded and provides the best route to save money. This will push our country forward and bit by bit eventually release us from this debt and allow us to work on more valuable projects, like medicare and education. We also propose to bring our troops home from the several countries that we currently occupy, and let them work as skilled laborers, allowing us to spend less on the Military and more on our country and our people.

                        <p>
                            When we state the problem, it is not going to be a clear cut answer. the problem is going to be what caused it and what can we do to fix it. If there is a group of homeless people in a common area, the government gives money to them and hopes for the better. With this new program we will find the large group of homeless and find out what caused them to get homeless in the first place: which might be the lack of education, addiction to drugs, or/and other problems, which would be the root of this situation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Next we would direct the homeless to specific programs such as letting them go to community college so they can get a degree and a good job. The government could give privately owned humanitarian organizations, categorical grants that would help the homeless receive the help they need. The programs would be in charge of a certain region, so that the programs would not be overwhelmed and, more effective.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Lastly, the CEO's or the leaders of the humanitarian aid programs will give a monthly report of their accomplishments and the success they have had. The check ups will be every 3 months and, the government will continue giving them categorical grants the more they succeed. But if they do not meet the requirements/expectations then we will decrease the funding to the organization.

                            The average citizen is being disenfranchised. We are losing what makes America great - our system of democracy. We are becoming an oligarchy, a system where only the rich have control of government. In fact, according to a <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9354310">Princeton study</a>, average Americans have a "statistically insignificant" impact in society.

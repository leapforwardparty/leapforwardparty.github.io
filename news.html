                    Excited for the debates to begin, Emma will be presenting her platform publicly tomorrow at Mission Vista High School. Come in to Ms. Atkins' room to watch and support her on her way to victory of the Mission Vista High Presidential Election.

                <p>
                    The Unicorn Party has been found guilty of plagiarizing their logo from the internet. Can we trust this party with the responsibility of our nation when they can't be trusted to create a mascot on their own?

                    UNLP quoted, "Cristofer is 0/5 of a person!"
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Not seeming to catch a break, UNLP has officially stated that they think Mr. Mayers, and in abstraction all black people, are worth 0/5 of a person. Mr. Mayers, a contributing member in society, has stated that attacks like these are a part of the institutional rascism he and his fellow black citizens deal with everyday. Can we have someone who doesn't support racial equality in the most powerful seat of the United States?

                    Yes folks you read that right, is Mr. Meyer hiding a secret life outside of politics? Evidence has come through that suggests Mr. Meyer is collaborating with the Egyptians to bring mummies and dictatorship to America!

                <p>
                    College tuition is crushing our nation. Higher education should be a guaranteed experience for all Americans, regardless of family income. This is why the Leap Forward Party wants to make public colleges free.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How will we pay for this? The states will pay for 1/3 of the bill, and the government will pay for the rest. As to how the government will pay for it's end of the bargain, we will institure a tax on Wall Street Speculation, in which investment bankers gamble on high risk investments. These gambles can be disastrous, as seen in the housing crisis of 2008.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have had enough of bailing our Wall Street, it's time for them to bail us out of college debt!

                    Emma Ryan beats out Carter Shirley by a narrow 1 vote at the primary elections. Emma Ryan now has the chance of making history as being the first leap forward presidential candidate and can be the first woman president of the United States of America. Let's leap forward for change and vote for Emma!

                    A New Party to challenge them all?!
                </h2>
                <p>
                   A shift in power among political parties is emerging as a new party has formed called the Leap Forward Party who is a strong competitor to the GOP and Democratic party. The Leap Forward party was formed because it's supporters were fed up with the injustices happening in the United States and wanted real change. They appeal to many Americans due to their policies on the economy (Progressive tax system) and political reform (getting wealth out of politics). We may have a critical election on our hands as the Leap Forward candidates are now second and third in the polls which may indicate real change coming to America in the upcoming years.
